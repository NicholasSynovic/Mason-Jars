Remember when I sliced my hand open?
I love you because you kept me calm
Remember when I dropped you off at Marquette?
I love you because you have grown so much at Marquette
Remember when COVID-19 first hit?
I love you because we had each other
Remember our COVID-19 scare and we couldn't see each other for two weeks? 
I love you because when I can't see you I don't feel whole
Remember when we lasted for this long?
I love you because there is no one else that I would rather be with
Remember when we went on vacation with my family?
I love you because you kick-ass at fishing
