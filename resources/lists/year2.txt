Remember when you asked me to prom?
I love you because you wanted to bring a boomer like me to prom
Remember our anniversary at the Hancock Tower?
I love you because you made me get over my fear of heights
Remember when we snuck into OG's and sang karoke?
I love you because you make me want to do ballsy things for you
Remember when I first smoked pot and you were so unhappy about it?
I love you because you change your mindset
Remember all the times that I came back to visit you?
I love you because I always look forward to seeing you
Remember when we went to Lollapoloza
